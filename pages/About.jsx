          Hello there! We're Mika and Asya, and we're the two faces behind
          Simple Pen. You could say we're just starting out! We’re currently two
          friends knee-deep in web development course studies, completely
          obsessed with learning how to build useful and beautiful things on the
          internet. This whole website is actually one of our passion projects -
          an assignment we truly loved putting together.
        </p>
        <p>
          We designed Simple Pen because we realised how much time we spend
          jumping between different apps every day. So, we thought: why not
          build one single, calm space? That’s why this hub exists! Whether you
          need to quickly check your email, jot down a reminder in the notepad,
          or find your next great read in the bookstore, we built this site to
          be your go-to, dependable daily tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re passionate about coding, love working together, and honestly
          can't wait to finish our studies and start our full-time careers in
          this field. We hope you enjoy using Simple Pen as much as we enjoyed
          creating it!
